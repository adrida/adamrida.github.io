My name is Adam, I am based in Paris, France, a data scientist with a background in AI research and CS. I have worked in different companies (Societe Generale, AXA, Qantev, Rebellion Research) in topics related to applied ML and data science.
For a year, I was a PhD candidate at Sorbonne University in the Trustworthy and Responsible AI Lab (TRAIL), a joint venture between Sorbonne and AXA. I was working on topics related to explainable AI in the context of model dynamics and concept drift. I published a research paper this year at the DynXAI workshop of ECML 2023.
I left the PhD to refocus on more applied topics and get closer to the industry without losing the proximity to academic research but I would love to be back in research at some point.

Before that, I obtained my Engineer degree (Master's degree) at CY Tech, in France and went through [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) where I learned to code in C.
In parallel with my experiences, I have built different side projects to explore different technologies.

Outside of tech, my main hobby is aviation. I am currently working towards my Private Pilot License (PPL) in France and have a few flight hours.


My areas of interest lie in the following:

- XAI and concept drift but more generally AI-Human interactions and how to use AI to augment human's abilities
- Outlier detection and unsupervised approaches
- Deep learning and latent representations
- LLMs and their ability to augment current unsolved NLP tasks (RAG, document parsing, knowledge representation)
- More generally, projects applying SOTA methods to solve real-life and high-impact
