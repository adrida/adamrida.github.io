[CV]

My name is Adam, I am based in Paris, France and I am a data scientist with a background in AI research and CS. I have worked in different companies (Societe Generale, AXA, Qantev, Rebellion Research) in topics related to applied ML and data science.
For a year, I was a PhD candidate at Sorbonne University in the Trustworthy and Responsible AI Lab (TRAIL), which is a joint venture between Sorbonne and AXA. I was working on topics related ton explainable AI in the context of model dynamics and concept drift. I have published a research paper during this year at the DynXAI workshop of ECML 2023. 
I left the PhD to refocus on more applied topics and get closer to the industry without loosing the proximity to academic research.

My areas of interest lies in the following:

- XAI and concept drift
- Outlier detection and unsupervised approaches
- Deep learning and latent representations
- LLMs and their ability to augment current unsolved NLP tasks (RAG, document parsing, knowledge representatiion)
- More generally, projects applying SOTA methods to solve real-life and high impact
